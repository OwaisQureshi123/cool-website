                                <p>CBT is a structured, goal-oriented therapy that focuses on identifying and changing negative thought patterns and behaviors.

The therapy involves practical strategies and skills to address current issues and improve emotional regulation. It is commonly used to treat conditions such as depression, anxiety, and stress.</p>

                                <p>EMDR is a trauma-focused therapy that helps individuals process and integrate distressing memories through guided eye movements. It involves recalling traumatic experiences while focusing on bilateral stimulation, such as eye movements or taps, to facilitate the processing of these memories. This approach aims to reduce the emotional charge of traumatic memories and alleviate associated symptoms. EMDR is particularly effective for treating post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other trauma-related issues.</p>

                                <p>ACT encourages individuals to accept their thoughts and feelings rather than struggling against them, while committing to actions aligned with their values. The therapy focuses on increasing psychological flexibility by helping individuals be present in the moment and take meaningful action despite difficulties. It integrates mindfulness techniques with behavioral change strategies. ACT is used to address a wide range of issues, including anxiety, depression, and chronic pain.</p>

                                <p>Therapists use creative processes such as drawing, painting, and sculpting to help individuals express emotions and explore thoughts that may be difficult to articulate verbally. The therapy provides a non-verbal outlet for self-expression, allowing for the exploration of underlying issues and personal experiences. It can enhance self-awareness, improve emotional regulation, and support personal growth. Art therapy is beneficial for individuals of all ages and is often used in conjunction with other therapeutic approaches.</p>
